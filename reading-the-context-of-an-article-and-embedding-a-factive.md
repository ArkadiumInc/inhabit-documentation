# Reading the Context of an Article & Embedding a Factive

Each piece of InHabit code is designed to serve factives that are relevant for a specific editorial category or content vertical. For example, you may want to place one piece of InHabit code across your Sports articles, and another across your Entertainment articles. You can work with your account manager to implement a strategy that best meets your goals.

When the InHabit code is installed, it automatically reads the page and embeds a factive. If no relevant factive can be generated, InHabit will not embed anything. This ensures that your users will only see/interact with InHabit factives that make sense editorially. As a result, you can freely implement InHabit code across a large number of articles that belong to the same editorial category or content vertical.
