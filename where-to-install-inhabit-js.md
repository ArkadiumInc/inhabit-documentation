# Where to Install InHabit

For optimal performance, we recommend implementing the code in the upper-third of article, and across the full width of your main content block. InHabit will automatically re-size embedded factives for mobile devices.

### If you have a test environment:

We recommend placing InHabit code on 1 or more pages within a test environment prior to going live. Grant your account manager access to your test environment, and our team will check that everything is implemented properly.

### If not:

We recommend placing InHabit code on a handful of pages. Let your account manager know which pages contain InHabit code, and our team will check that everything is implemented properly.
