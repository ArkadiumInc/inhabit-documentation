# Brand Safety

It is always best practice for engineering teams and webmasters to utilize mechanisms of control that they have developed. However, the InHabit platform contains features to ensure that Factives are not embedded within articles that are about a sensitive subject matter. 



### Taxonomy Filters

In the process of reading what an article is about, InHabit assigns a series of "taxonomies" to an article, along with confidence scores for each one. For example, an article about a recent NBA game may get assigned this taxonomy:

`Sports------>Basketball     94%    Confident? Y`

`Clothing------>Blazers      10%    Confident? N`



Wheres an article about a domestic dispute involving an athelete may get assigned this taxonomy:

`Sports------>Basketball     97%    Confident? Y`

`Society----->Crime          75%    Confident? Y` 



Each Factive utilizes taxonomies and confidence scores, among many other factors, to determine whether or not it can produce relevant content to show. In addition, you and your account manager can set "overall filters" according to your brand's specific needs.
