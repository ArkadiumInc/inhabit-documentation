# About InHabit

Our JavaScript is lightweight and loads asynchronously. Meaning, it will never delay a page from loading.

Implementing InHabit within articles involves one step:  copying and pasting a line of JavaScript.  You can find this code within your administration panel, which will be set up by your account manager. Reach out to your account manager if you need help accessing it.
